An important medical application of natural language generation (NLG) is to build assistive systems that take X-ray
images of a patient and generate a textual report describing clinical observations in the images. This is a clinically
important task, offering the potential to reduce radiologistsâ€™ repetitive work and generally improve clinical
communication.

## 1. Task Overview

Given one or multiple chest X-rays from one study, the participants must generate the corresponding radiology report.
In the scope of this task, two sections are considered: findings and impressions. Each section will have its own separate
evaluation and leaderboard. These sections may be produced using either a single system or two distinct systems.

### 1.1 Rules

> All participants will be invited to submit a paper describing their solution to be included in
>
the [Proceedings of the 23rd Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) at ACL 2024](https://aclanthology.org/venues/bionlp/).
> If you do not wish to write a paper, you must at least provide a thorough description of your system which will be
> included in the overview paper for this task. Otherwise, your submission (and reported scores) will not be taken into
> account.

- Participants must agree to sign and follow the data access agreements for the provided dataset.
- Participants may use private data to train (or pre-train) their systems, make a submission, and write a technical
  paper describing their solution. However, their score will not be counted towards the general leaderboard. In order to
  validate your leaderboard ranking, all the data used for the submission must be in some way available to other
  researchers.
- If participants employ LLMs, generated data and the prompting strategies must be provided and described clearly so
  that results can be reproduced.
- <span style="color: red;">Using the information in the official MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert validation and test sets is *
  <b>strictly prohibited</b>, including their labels and reports.</span>

## 1.2 Timeline

- **Release of the training and validation datasets:** February 22nd (Tuesday), 2024
- **Release of the public and hidden test dataset:** April 19th (Friday), 2024
- **System submission deadline:** May 15th (Wednesday), 2024
- **System papers due date:** May 17th (Friday), 2024
- **Notification of acceptance:** June 17th (Monday), 2024
- **Camera-ready system papers due:** July 1st (Monday), 2024
- **BioNLP Workshop Date:** August 16th (Friday), 2024

All deadlines are 11:59 PM ("Anywhere on Earth").

## 2. Data

Below are the data used for the challenge. Please note:

- The training and validation sets are grouped by study, but **not** grouped by subjects.
- The studies in the test sets will be unseen studies.
- The official language of PadChest and BIMCV-COVID19 is Spanish, where their reports have been translated using GPT-4.
- <span style="color: red;">Using the information in the official MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert validation and test sets is *
  <b>strictly prohibited</b>, including their labels and reports.</span>

### 2.3 Test

Please see [https://huggingface.co/datasets/StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public/discussions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public/discussions)

### 2.4 Access

Here are the steps to access the dataset of this challenge with the correct splits:

1) The datasets (image and findings/impression pairs) of CheXpert, BIMCV-COVID19 (en), PadChest (en) and OpenI can be
   access through
   the <img src="https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo-noborder.svg" width="15"> huggingface dataset at
   the
   following
   url: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public).
   Once you have been granted access, you can invoke the dataset using the following:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public")
```

2) You'll have to handle the MIMIC-CXR processing on your own by
   utilizing the [make-interpret-mimic-cxr.py](https://storage.googleapis.com/vilmedic_dataset/RRG24/make-interpret-mimic-cxr.py)
   script.
   It's crucial to use this script as it ensures the proper splits are defined. Please have the following structure
   ready (files folder is from [mimic-cxr-jpg](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/)):

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ p10
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ p11
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ p19
â”œâ”€â”€ make-interpret-mimic-cxr.py
â”œâ”€â”€ mimic-cxr-2.0.0-metadata.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ mimic-cxr-2.0.0-split.csv
â””â”€â”€ mimic_cxr_sectioned.csv
```

And run `python make-interpret-mimic-cxr.py`. If you have a hash error (i.e. 
the created files arent what was expected), please email me at jbdel at stanford dot edu.<br/>

Then, you can then collate both datasets as such:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset, Sequence, Image, DatasetDict, concatenate_datasets

dataset = load_dataset("StanfordAIMI/interpret-cxr-public")
dataset_mimic = load_dataset(
    "json",
    data_files={"train": "train_mimic.json", "validation": "val_mimic.json"},
).cast_column("images", Sequence(Image()))
dataset_final = DatasetDict({"train": concatenate_datasets([dataset["train"], dataset_mimic["train"]]),
                             "validation": concatenate_datasets([dataset["validation"], dataset_mimic["validation"]])})
dataset_final.save_to_disk("path/to/dataset/directory")
```
Please note that the save_to_dict operation can take time:<br/>
`
Saving the dataset (147/147 shards): 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 550395/550395 [7:28:42<00:00, 20.44 examples/s]
`

The final dataset should be as detailed below:

```bash
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['source', 'findings', 'images', 'impression', 'images_path'],
        num_rows: 550395
    })
    validation: Dataset({
        features: ['source', 'findings', 'images', 'impression', 'images_path'],
        num_rows: 14111
    })
})
```

3) One more dataset, VinDr-CXR, can be used as training data if you wish, but we do not process on our end. You will
   need to do it
   yourself at [https://vindr.ai/datasets/cxr](https://vindr.ai/datasets/cxr).

### 3. Metrics
